# World-Spinner
A 2D physics based platformer where the player can flip the rotation of the world and it's gravity. Players will have to move a box via changes in gravity with the rotation function to insert it into the correct spot on the level, opening the door leading into the next. Obstacles such as spikes, shooting enemies, and rotating blades serve to keep players on their toes.
In the Assets/Scripts folder, you will find all of the code used in this project.
